    Building software to improve patient care is where my professional passion
    lies. I thrive when great engineering, solid execution and focused care
    supports everyone. I love creating systems and teams that accomplish great things while
    nurturing talent, providing opportunities and helping all involved grow.

  <p>Two years ago I started <a href="http://172.93.55.89">AlohaMD</a>, a telehealth consulting
    service in the SF Bay Area. We&apos;ve stopped taking on new contracts. See our case-studies for the
    work we undertook.</p>,

  <p>I&apos;m also building <a href="#">Sanjay the IT Guy</a>, a time management game (to the likes of
    DinerDash) that puts you in the shoes of Sanjay an under-paid IT Guy who has to put out literal
    and figurative fires in his office.</p>,
